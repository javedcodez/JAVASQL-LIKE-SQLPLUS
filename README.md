# JAVASQL-LIKE-SQLPLUS

JavaSql is a console-based application that simulates a SQL command-line interface, inspired by Oracle's SQL*Plus. Designed for educational purposes, this application provides users with an interactive environment to practice basic authentication and command input, similar to working with a relational database management system (RDBMS).
